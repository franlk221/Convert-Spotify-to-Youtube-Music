# Copy Spotify Playlists to Youtube Music
Didn't like what spotify did with their API changes so moving all playlists to ytmusic.

# To Start
* Create [OAuth credentials for ytmusic](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/index.html) and add them `oauth.json` and `requirements.txt`
* [Create a project in spotify developer](https://developer.spotify.com/) and update `requirements.txt` with the client id and client secret
